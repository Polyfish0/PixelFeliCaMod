## Questions

The main discussion can be found here: https://github.com/jjyao88/unlock-felica-pixel/issues/3

* Question 1: Does Osaifu-Keitai care about MOBILE_DEVICE_INFORMATION_KEY aka 02020001?
  * Unknown, but you may want to consult https://github.com/jjyao88/unlock-felica-pixel/issues/3#issuecomment-1774193088 for your MDIK
* Question 2: Are the Pixel 8 MDIKs in the FeliCa database yet?
  * Unknown, but it works

## TODO 
* Maybe it'll be better to simply edit the config instead of trying to force a static MDIK or dynamically determine from a device table.
* Testing Pixel Watch 2

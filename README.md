# Pixel FeliCa Mod
A Magisk module to help prep your Pixel for enabling FeliCa. This module leans heavily on [kormax's guide](https://github.com/kormax/osaifu-keitai-google-pixel) and assumes you are familiar with its concepts. This module uses the Solution 2i approach and sets 00000018 in common.cfg to 1. Please read the TODO for additional discussion.

You will still need the various Osaifu-Keitai, FeliCa, and Google Wallet apps listed as well as a quick VPN to Japan. Sideloading with `adb install` may be necessary.

This module is still under construction. I'll be cleaning it up for proper tagging, attribution, and zipping. Use at your own risk. Should be able to clone and zip up the contents of the root folder as a functioning module.

I have not tested this in the wild and will not be able to do so until January if at all.

Tested on:
* Pixel 7 (US)
* Pixel 8 Pro (US)

# Pixel FeliCa Mod
A Magisk module to help prep your Pixel for enabling FeliCa. This module leans heavily on [kormax's guide](https://github.com/kormax/osaifu-keitai-google-pixel) and assumes you are familiar with its concepts. This module uses the Solution 2i approach and sets 00000018 in common.cfg to 1.

You will still need the various Osaifu-Keitai, FeliCa, and Google Wallet apps listed as well as a quick VPN to Japan. Sideloading with `adb install` may be necessary.

This module is still under construction. Use at your own risk.
